      <p>
        This is a simple React app that I built to learn React. I built it
        to learn React and to learn how to use the React Router library.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the following libraries:
        <ul>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>React Router</li>
          <li>React Bootstrap</li>
          <li>React Fontawesome</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
export default About;
